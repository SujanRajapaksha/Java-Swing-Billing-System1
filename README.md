## Features

* **Login Interface:** Secure access control using a username and password.
* **Placeholder Text:** Uses focus listeners to implement placeholder text for the username and password fields.
* **Product Management Table:** Allows users to add products with rate, quantity, and automatically calculate the total.
* **Subtotal Calculation:** Automatically sums up the totals of all added products.
* **Billing Display:** Generates a basic bill/invoice header and displays the added items and final subtotal in a text area, ready for printing.
* **Clear Functionality:** Provides a way to clear the input fields after adding a product.

##  Technologies Used

* **Language:** Java
* **GUI Framework:** Java Swing
* **Development Environment:** NetBeans IDE (The project includes `.form` files generated by NetBeans' GUI builder.)

##  Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following installed:

* **Java Development Kit (JDK)** (Version 8 or newer is typically suitable for Swing projects.)
* **NetBeans IDE** (Recommended for easy handling of the `.form` and `.java` files.)

### Installation and Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/Java-Swing-Billing-System.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/Java-Swing-Billing-System.git)
    ```
2.  **Open in NetBeans:**
    * Open NetBeans IDE.
    * Go to `File` > `Open Project...` and select the cloned project folder.
3.  **Run the Application:**
    * Right-click on the project in the Projects window and select **Run**.
    * The application starts with the `Login` frame.

##  Login Credentials

The current implementation (based on the `Login.java` file structure, which seems to contain the authentication logic) would require you to check the hardcoded credentials (if any) or connect it to a database.

* **Default Username:** (Insert the default username used in your code, e.g., `admin`)
* **Default Password:** (Insert the default password, e.g., `123`)

##  File Structure

* `src/inf/Login.java` and `src/inf/Login.form`: Code for the application's login screen.
* `src/inf/Mainframe.java` and `src/inf/Mainframe.form`: Code for the main billing interface.
* `src/inf/Gemini_Gene5.jpg`, `Screenshot 2025-11-26 205552.jpg`, etc.: Image files used in the GUI.
